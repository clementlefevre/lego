A not so successful attempt to use linear optimization.
Using the **Kaggle Lego dataset**, i tried to recreate the legendary Lego Castle using current catalog with the minimum wasted components.
I could not figure out a better alternative than a brute force approach, which granted me for a public shaming (see my question [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2581590/combinatorial-optimization-with-lego-sets)
